This crack segmentation dataset contains around 11.200 images which are merged from 12 available crack segmentation dataset.
The name prefix of each image is assigned to the corresponding dataset that the image belong to. 
There're also images which contain no crack, which could be filtered out by the pattern "noncrack*"
All the images in the dataset are resized to the size of (448, 448).

the two folders images and masks contain all the images
the two folders train and test contain training and testing images splitted from the two above folder. 
the splitting is stratified so that the proportion of each dataset in the train and test folder are similar
